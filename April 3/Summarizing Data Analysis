Exploratory Data Analysis means analyzing the datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often visually.
This is the first step of any data analysis.
Objectives:

    Know the data types of the dataset â€“ whether continuous/discreet/categorical
    Understand how the data is distributed
    Extract important input variables for the analysis
    Identify outliers
    To identity patterns, if exists

Exploratory Analysis Techniques:

    Box-Plot
    Histogram
    Trend analysis
    Scatter Plots

Steps to summarize sample data for EDA: 
i)Identify Business Problem:
 				
ii)Data Acquisition:

iii)Process/Clean Data:
    Formatting the data as per the data analytical tools we use.
    Missing data handling
    Data Transformations like normalizing the data Identifying outliers & handling etc.

iv)Exploratory Analysis:
 				
    to understand causes of an observed event
    to understand the nature of the data we are dealing with
    assess assumptions on which our analysis will be based
    to identify the key features in the data needed for the analysis
